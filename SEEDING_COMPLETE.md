- **users** - Role-based access control

## üöÄ How to Use the Seeding System

### Quick Start
```bash
# Seed basic data (recommended for most users)
npm run seed:database

# Fix sample data if needed
npm run seed:fix-samples

# Comprehensive seeding (advanced features)
npm run seed:comprehensive
```

### Manual Execution
```bash
# Basic seeding
node backend/scripts/simple-seed.js

# Advanced seeding
node backend/scripts/seed-database.js

# Fix samples only
node backend/scripts/fix-samples.js
```

## üìä Data Generated

### Realistic Laboratory Workflow
1. **Case Creation** - 50 paternity/legal test cases
2. **Sample Collection** - Family members with proper relationships
3. **PCR Processing** - Realistic batch processing with plate layouts
4. **Electrophoresis** - Genetic analyzer run simulation
5. **STR Analysis** - Complete genetic profiles and statistical analysis
6. **Report Generation** - Professional laboratory reports

### Quality Features
